# 📚 Human-Computer Interaction Teaching Repository 🖥️

Welcome to our Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) teaching repository! This repository is designed to provide valuable resources and insights into the fascinating world of HCI, with a particular focus on Nielsen's 10 heuristics. 

🔑 Nielsen's 10 Heuristics: Nielsen's heuristics, proposed by Jakob Nielsen, are a set of ten fundamental principles used for evaluating user interfaces. These heuristics act as guidelines to identify potential usability issues and improve the overall user experience. The 10 heuristics are:

1. Visibility of system status 👀
2. Match between system and the real world 🌍
3. User control and freedom 🚪
4. Consistency and standards 📏
5. Error prevention 🚫
6. Recognition rather than recall 🧠
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use ⚙️
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 🎨
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 🩹
10. Help and documentation 📖
