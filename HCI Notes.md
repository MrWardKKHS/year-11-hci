# Introduction
You will be required to respond in short and / or extended answers (800–1500 words in total) to questions relating to a screen-capture video showing a user interacting with a website or application.

Candidates may be asked to refer to specific usability heuristics (from Jakob Nielsen’s [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)).

# Demonstrate understanding of HCI - Achieved

> [!warning] Candidates who were not achieved commonly:
>Candidates who were awarded Not Achieved commonly:
>- identified less than four heuristics
>- repeated heuristics in their response
>- did not name the heuristic they described
>- provided screenshots and descriptions but did not display understanding of the heuristics
>- provided screenshots but did not describe the heuristics they illustrated
>- confused the meanings of specific heuristics (in particular ‘error prevention’ and ‘help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors’)
>- did not support their answers with evidence or screenshots


> [!hint] Candidates who were awarded Achievement commonly: 
> - described the role of their chosen interface
> - identified and accurately described four usability heuristics
> - used screenshots to illustrate their responses

-  describing the role of a chosen user interface for a specified task
-  identifying examples from a given human-computer interface that illustrate usability heuristics.

[[Heuristic 1 - Visibility of System Status]]
[[Heuristic 2 - Match between system and the real world]]
[[Heuristic 3 - User control and freedom]]
[[Heuristic 4 - Consistency and Standards]]
[[Heuristic 5 - Error Prevention]]
[[Heuristic 6 - Recognition rather than recall]]
[[Heuristic 7 - flexibility and efficiency of use]]
[[Heuristic 8 - Aesthetics and minimalist design]]
[[Heuristic 9 - help users recognise diagnose and recover from errors]]
[[Heuristic 10 - Help and documentation]]

# In depth understanding of HCI - Merit

>[!hint] Candidates who were awarded MERIT commonly:
> - evaluated two or more usability heuristics
>- used evaluative comments or gave a mark out of ten with justification for why
> - provided multiple examples of the usability heuristics supported by screenshots.

- Evaluate HCI in terms of heuristics

# Comprehensive understanding of HCI - Excellence
>[!hint] Candidates who were awarded Excellence commonly:
>- compared the two interfaces in terms of three or more heuristics, demonstrating an insightful and comprehensive understanding of the heuristics
> - used findings from the compare / contrast section to suggest improvements
> - suggested improvements related to usability heuristics
> - supported their answers with appropriate screenshots
> - stated which website performed better for each usability heuristic and backed up their response with appropriate commentary.

- Compare and contrast related interfaces
- Suggest improvements to an interface
